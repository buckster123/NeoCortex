# Neo-Cortex Banner Image Generation Prompt

Use this prompt with AI image generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)

---

## Main Prompt

```
A futuristic neural network visualization representing an AI memory system called "Neo-Cortex".

The image shows a glowing brain-like structure made of interconnected nodes and pathways,
with three distinct color-coded regions:
- Gold/amber nodes (village/shared memory)
- Blue nodes (private memory)
- Purple bridges connecting regions (cross-agent dialogue)

Digital memory fragments float around like constellation points.
Subtle data streams flow between nodes.

Style: Clean, modern, tech-aesthetic
Background: Dark gradient (deep navy to black)
Accents: Neon glow effects, subtle circuit board patterns
Feel: Professional, sleek, futuristic but approachable

Aspect ratio: 3:1 (banner format) or 16:9
Leave space at center for "NEO-CORTEX" text overlay

High contrast, minimalist but striking.
No text in the image itself.
```

## Alternative Prompts

### Minimal/Abstract Version
```
Abstract visualization of interconnected memory nodes.
Three overlapping circles of light: gold, blue, purple.
Neural pathway connections between them.
Dark background, glowing edges.
Clean, minimal, modern tech aesthetic.
3:1 aspect ratio, centered composition.
```

### Cosmic/Ethereal Version
```
A cosmic brain made of starlight and neural connections.
Three nebula-like regions: golden, sapphire, violet.
Memory fragments as tiny stars orbiting the structure.
Deep space background with subtle aurora effects.
Ethereal, mystical yet technological.
3:1 aspect ratio.
```

### Circuit/Technical Version
```
Stylized circuit board brain with vector aesthetics.
Three distinct circuit zones with different trace colors.
Data flowing through pathways like electricity.
Dark PCB green background with glowing traces.
Technical, precise, engineering aesthetic.
3:1 aspect ratio.
```

## Recommended Tools

1. **Midjourney** - Best for artistic, stylized results
2. **DALL-E 3** - Good for following complex prompts
3. **Stable Diffusion** - More control, local generation
4. **Leonardo.ai** - Good balance of quality and control

## Post-Processing

After generating:
1. Add "NEO-CORTEX" text in center (font: Orbitron, Exo 2, or similar tech font)
2. Ensure readable contrast
3. Export at 1600x533 (3:1) or 1920x1080 (16:9)
4. Save as `neo-cortex-banner.png`
